# rick-experiments

This repository contains experimental data and results from our evaluation of the test and mock generation tool, [**rick**](https://github.com/castor-software/pankti#rick), with three applications: Graphhopper, Gephi, and PDFBox.

Under the respective directory for each project, we present:
- The production workload (for Gephi, we describe the general steps to interact with the tool)
- The instructions to run the application with the workload
- The tests and resource files generated by **rick** using the data captured from these interactions

Additionally, this repository also includes a [detailed account of the survey](https://github.com/castor-software/rick-experiments/blob/main/survey/RICK_DeveloperSurvey.pdf) conducted with 5 software developers between June and July, 2022.
